For this task you will need to use your raspberry pi with sonic pi installed.

###Installing Version 1
Enter the following commands at the terminal.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sonic-pi
```
Sonic pi should now be available in you menu, under education.

###Installing Version 2 (better)
