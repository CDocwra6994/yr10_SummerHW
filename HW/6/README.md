##Instructions
For this computational thinking challenge you should attempt to find a answer to problem set below. The answer to the problem is only part of your response, ***how*** you found the answer is what matters.

Once you can explain the solution you might try to write a computer program to simulate or model the solution. It might even generalise the problem and provide solutions for ***similar*** problems.

##Grading
|Grade|What must I do?|
|-----|---------------|
|D|I will be able to provide an answer to the problem.|
|C|I will be able to provide an answer to the problem, including an explanation of the algorithm / process.|
|B|I will be able to provide a clear explanation of the algorithm I developed to solve to problem.|
|A/A*|I have been able to demonstrate my understanding of the solution to this problem and represented the algorithm using a computer program.|

##The Problem - Ferrying Soliders
A detachment of **25** soliders need to cross a deep wide river, with no bridge in sight. They spot two boys playing around in a row boat near the shore.
